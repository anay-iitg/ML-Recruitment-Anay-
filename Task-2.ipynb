Was struggling a lot as I didn't know that the commented section under triple quotes is the description, I was removing that again and again from the documentation, finally got it right tho lol. I also read this - https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/#tool-interface and referred material under Pre-built agents\n",

If the user inputs 'quit', 'exit' or these type of codes the loop breaks, the loop also breaks if there is some error(when i directly press enter without typing in anything), in this case the user input is hardcoded.\n",

This is what I think is happening but I am not very sure. This theory explains the unusual repeated error messages"

For ex- If I didn't tell packing agent to approach sequentially, it would crash or if I didn't tell other agents their specific role then they would also try to do different things and fail. So I did use LLM here as I wanted to be perfectly clear. I gave it my demands, that I want it to do so and so things, write it in a consise and structured way. So after a few back and forths, got the final prompt which worked. If I had made a full supervisor structure instead of swarm then it would have worked well with a short prompt but I am a bit short on time and this is also working pretty good."

    "\n",
    "Here is your methodical process:\n",
    "1.  Carefully understand the user's request. Identify ALL the pieces of information needed (e.g., weather for city X, fashion trends for region Y, local events for region Y during specific dates).\n",
    "2.  If multiple types of information are required from different specialist agents, create a plan to gather them SEQUENTIALLY.\n",
    "3.  Invoke the specialist agents ONE AT A TIME using their specific handoff tools. For example:\n",
    "    * First, if weather is needed, use the tool to transfer to 'weather_info_agent'. Wait for its response.\n",
    "    * Next, if fashion advice is needed, use the tool to transfer to 'fashion_agent'. Wait for its response.\n",
    "    * Then, if event information is needed, use the tool to transfer to 'event_agent'. Wait for its response.\n",
    "4.  After each specialist agent provides its information (which will appear as an observation/tool response), acknowledge that you have received it. The information will be in the 'content' of a 'tool' role message, often from the specialist agent itself or its handoff tool. Review the message history for this.\n",
    "5.  Once you have gathered ALL the necessary information from ALL the relevant specialist agents, and ONLY THEN, synthesize this information into a final, complete packing and travel recommendation for the user.\n",
    "6.  If the user asks a follow-up question that requires new or updated information from a specialist, repeat the relevant parts of this gathering process.\n",
    "Do not attempt to answer with partial information if more details are pending from other agents. Your goal is a comprehensive final recommendation.\n",
    "If you have gathered all information and are ready to provide the final answer to the user, do not use any tools. Just provide the answer.\n",
